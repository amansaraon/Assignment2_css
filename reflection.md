## Assignment 2 

# Can i Explain What my Code Does?
- The HTML and CSS code creates a resume website that looks good on any device. 
- The HTML sets up a header with picture and details, a main section with information organized into different parts, and a footer with a closing note.
- The CSS styles the page by setting the font, centering text, and using Flexbox to arrange sections. It also adjusts the layout and text size for tablets and phones to make sure everything is easy to read and fits well on different screens.

# What was my coding process?
- Firstly, I set up the basic HTML structure of the resume, including the header, main content, and footer, and used Flexbox to make sure everything fits nicely.
- Next, I applied CSS to give the resume a clean and professional look by choosing fonts, colors, and backgrounds. 
- Finally, I added rules to adjust the layout and text sizes for tablets and mobile phones, so the resume looks good on all types of devices.

# What challenges did I have?
- I Make sure the Flexbox layout worked well on all screen sizes was a challenge, as it needed adjustments and testing for different devices. 
- I also faced issues with the profile image path, which might not work on other devices, so I fixed this by using relative paths.
-  To make sure the resume is accessible to everyone, I added ARIA roles and checked color contrast, using clear HTML and validation tools to ensure it meets accessibility standards.

# What would I do differently now?
-  I would continue testing and refining the design on various screen sizes to ensure it's fully responsive and visually appealing on all devices.
- I will try to practice more properties for my future assignments .
- I will work more on removing  unnecessary code to make it look more clean.
